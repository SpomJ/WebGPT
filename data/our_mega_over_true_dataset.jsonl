Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of plate boundary: convergent, divergent, or transform.

The fission process often produces gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. Nuclear fission was discovered on 19 December 1938 in Berlin by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. Physicists Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch explained it theoretically in January 1939. Frisch named the process \\\"fission\\\" by analogy with biological fission of living cells. In their second publication on nuclear fission in February 1939, Hahn and Strassmann predicted the existence and liberation of additional neutrons during the fission process, opening up the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction. For heavy nuclides, it is an exothermic reaction which can release large amounts of energy both as electromagnetic radiation and as kinetic energy of the fragments."}, {"role": "bot", "content": "Nuclear fission is a reaction where an atom's nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, usually producing gamma photons and releasing a significant amount of energy.
